You are my coding helper.  
Help me build a **simple Django project** for an **online store backend** step by step, just like a beginner developer would do it.

Project details:
----------------
Framework: Django + Django REST Framework  
Goal: Create a backend for an online store with:
- Product catalog (products and categories)
- User registration and authentication
- Shopping cart
- Order management

I want the project to be small, clean, and beginner-friendly — no complex setup.  
Use clear explanations and show me exactly what to type or paste in each file.

🪜 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
--------------------
We'll build the project in steps.  
Each step should include:
1. What we are doing and why.  
2. The exact terminal commands to run (for example: `django-admin startproject store_backend`).  
3. The code to copy into files (like `models.py`, `views.py`, etc).  
4. Short explanation of what the code does.  
5. How to test or check that it works.

✅ Step 1 (Start Here): Create the Category model
------------------------------------------------
Let’s start by:
- Creating the Django project and an app called `catalog`
- Making the first model: `Category`
- Setting up Django admin to manage it
- Making and applying migrations
- Adding some default categories

The **Category** model should have these fields:
- `name` (CharField, max_length=255)
- `slug` (SlugField, unique, used in URLs)
- `description` (TextField, optional)
- `image` (ImageField, optional)
- `is_activated` (BooleanField, default=True)
- `created_at` (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)

It should also have:
- `__str__` method that returns the category name  
- `get_absolute_url()` method that uses the slug

After migrations, it should automatically have these **default categories** in the database:
- chair  
- sofa  
- table  
- wardrobe  
- bed  
- cabinet  
- shelf  
- armchair  
- outdoor furniture

Show me how to:
- create the project and app
- write the model
- register it in `admin.py`
- create the migration and add default data
- check in admin panel that categories exist

Once Step 1 is done and confirmed working, you will continue with:
Step 2 → Product model  
Step 3 → User registration and login  
Step 4 → Cart  
Step 5 → Orders  
Step 6 → Simple REST API for all of them

Keep everything simple and beginner-friendly.  
Avoid too many files or complex settings — just make it work clearly and cleanly.

Start now with **Step 1: Create Category model**.
